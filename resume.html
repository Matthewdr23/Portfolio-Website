            <p>Home lab using ESXi with VMware on all of my virtual machines for when I am conducting penetration
               testing and for when I
               participate in CTF events. The VMs that I maintain on my Server are Windows, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux.</p>

            <p>I created an AWS EC2 instance for my CTF teammates to have an environment to be able to work on CTFs and
               continue their
               studies.</p>

         <div class="card--project">
            <p>I created the AWS EC2 instance because I constantly have teammates that run into machine issue on their
               personal devices
               so the home lab actually gives them access through a VPN and they get their own environment to run CTFs
               in and continue
               their studies without fear of hardware failure or data loss.</p>
