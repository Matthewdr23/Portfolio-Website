            <p>I created a home Splunk server to enhance my data analysis and security monitoring skills. It allowed me to gain more hands-on experince with industry standard tools. I was able to monitor my home network and used the log data to look through and gain a better understanding of how network traffic moves through my home. </p>

            <p>I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. Where I observed live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. 
               I used a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map</p>
