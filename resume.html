            <p>Home lab using ESXi with VMware on all of my virtual machines for when I am conducting penetration
               testing and for when I
               participate in CTF events. The VMs that I maintain on my Server are Windows, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux.</p>

               so the home lab actually gives them access through a VPN and they get their own environment to run CTFs
               in and continue
               their studies without fear of hardware failure or data loss.</p>
